## Overview

Semantic Kernel is a powerful framework designed to enhance AI capabilities. The kernel types defined in this repository help manage various operations and configurations. This enum simplifies the selection of kernel types for different scenarios, making it easier to implement AI solutions.

## Features

- **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-use enum for kernel types.
- **Multiple Options**: Supports various configurations for diverse applications.
- **Integration Ready**: Works seamlessly with C# and .NET applications.
- **OpenAI Compatible**: Designed to work with OpenAI technologies.
- **Efficient Management**: Helps in managing kernel operations effectively.

## Installation

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UmairBilal-03/soenneker.semantickernel.enums.kerneltype.git
```

Next, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd soenneker.semantickernel.enums.kerneltype
```

You can then add the project to your solution or reference it in your application.

## Usage

To use the enum in your application, first include the namespace:

```csharp
using Soenneker.SemanticKernel.Enums;
```

You can then access the kernel types as follows:

```csharp
KernelType myKernel = KernelType.OpenAI;
```

This enum allows you to easily switch between different kernel types based on your application's requirements.

## Enum Types

Here are the various kernel types included in this enum:

- **OpenAI**: Represents the OpenAI kernel type.
- **Limiting**: Used for limiting configurations.
- **Manager**: For managing kernel operations.
- **Pool**: Represents a pool of kernel options.
- **Rate**: Used for rate-limiting operations.
- **Multiple**: Indicates support for multiple kernel types.

These types provide flexibility in managing your AI models and ensure that you can adapt to various needs.
